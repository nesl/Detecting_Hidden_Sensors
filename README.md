# Detecting_Hidden_Sensors

This repository is based on our work from our [USENIX paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/singh): "I Always Feel Like Somebody's Sensing Me! A Framework to Detect, Identify, and Localize Clandestine Wireless Sensors"

The following tutorial 

In this repository, we will use Camera as an example to show how our framework can be used to detect hidden clandestine sensors.



### Requirements




### Troubleshooting

Range: The performance depends upon the range of the sensors. For camera, typically the range is within 3m. However, since our framework is created to detect sensors in a small space like a room, the range is more than sufficient. 

### Create your own MAC Address Lookup Database
